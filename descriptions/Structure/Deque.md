# Deque

Deque is a double-sided queue. It supports 4 main operations: **push_front**, **push_back**, **pop_front** and **pop_back**.
**push_front** adds an item to end of deque.
**push_back** adds an item to start of deque.
**pop_front** returns last element from the end and removes it from deque.
**pop_back** returns first element from start and removes it from deque.
